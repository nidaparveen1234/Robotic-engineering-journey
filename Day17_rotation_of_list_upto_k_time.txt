Algorithm (List Rotation by K steps)

1. We are given a list containing a certain number of elements.
2. We are also given a value K, which represents how many times the rotation should be performed.
3. We repeat the rotation process from 0 up to K times using a loop.
4. In each rotation:
   - The last element of the list is moved to the first position.
   - The first element shifts to the second position.
   - The second element shifts to the third position, and so on.
5. After each rotation, the updated order is stored back into the original list.
6. This process continues until the rotation is completed K times, resulting in the final rotated list.
