1.	First, we will get a list.
This list contains the values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6.
	2.	We will take another list (result list).
This result list will be empty at the beginning and will store the results later.
	3.	We will find the length of the list and store it as n.
	4.	We will use a loop to go through each element of the list.
The loop will run from index 0 to n so that every element is checked once.
	5.	For each element, we will check:
	•	If the element is already present in the result list,
then we will increase its count by 1.
	•	Else, if the element is not present in the result list,
we will add that element to the result list and set its count as 1.
	6.	This way, each value in the list is checked only one time,
and the result list remembers how many times each value appeared.
	7.	After the loop finishes, we will print the result list,
which shows how many times each element appears in the original list.
