List is given.

low = 0
high = length of list − 1
result = −1

While low ≤ high:
	•	mid = (low + high) // 2
	•	If list[mid] > target
→ high = mid − 1
	•	Else if list[mid] < target
→ low = mid + 1
	•	Else if list[mid] == target
→ result = mid
→ break

After while loop:

Print result.

If target was found → result stores index.
If not found → result remains −1.
