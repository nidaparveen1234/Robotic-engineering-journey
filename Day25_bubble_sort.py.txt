1.	We take a list of numbers, for example: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
	2.	Sorting is needed because sorting helps searching faster.
	3.	We arrange the elements in ascending order.
	4.	We use two for loops.
	5.	The first for loop goes from the first element to the last element.
Its main purpose is to go through the list multiple times.
	6.	The second for loop is used to compare elements.
	7.	The second loop compares the current element with the next element.
	8.	First, it compares the first element and the second element.
	9.	If the first element is greater than or equal to the second element:
	•	Store the first element in a temporary variable.
	•	Store the second element in the first element’s place.
	•	Store the temporary value in the second element’s place.
	10.	This swap continues for each adjacent pair.
	11.	After one full pass of the second loop, the largest element moves to the end.
	12.	The first loop repeats this process until all elements are arranged.
	13.	The second loop runs up to one element less each time because the last elements are already sorted.
	14.	We manually trace each pass on paper to track comparisons and swaps.
	15.	Only the algorithm is written today, not the code.
