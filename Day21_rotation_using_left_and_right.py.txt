1. We have our normal list, start pointer, end pointer, outside the everything, outside.
2. Then rotate is equal to k modular n.
3. Then while r rotation greater than zero, we will get a value, I mean, which means this much rotation are what we need to do.
4. So we got the value.
5. So then we send this rotation into right rotation and left rotation. I mean, we could call this right rotation bracket rotation, left rotation bracket rotation.
6. Okay, now we will send them into the rotation.
7. After that, we would do our normal stuff, which is... No, no, no, no, no, a mistake.
8. We should do this: We should send right rotation to rotation, left rotation to rotation.
9. And in the right rotation function, we will use a while loop and a for loop to calculate that.
10. In a left rotation, we will use two while loops to calculate that.
11. And the final value is printed in each cases.
12. So after that function, we will have final values printed.
