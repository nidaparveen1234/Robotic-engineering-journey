# Python Foundations

## Day 1
Programs:
-Prime number check
-Reverse number
Notes:
-Converted logic from C to Python
-Corrected mistake between odd numbers and prime numbers.

## Day 2 – Prime & Palindrome Logic
-Implemented prime number check in Python
-Implemented palindrome check using reverse logic
-Debugged logical errors related to loops and return statements
-Focused on understanding logic rather than speed

## Day 3 – Local Development Setup

-Installed Python on Windows
-Set up VS Code for Python development
-Verified Python execution using terminal
-Implemented and tested prime list and prime check programs locally

## Day 4
-Implemented sum of digits logic
-Used loop-based digit extraction

## Day 5
-Practiced algorithm-to-code conversion
-Strengthened loop and condition thinking

## Day 6
-Worked with lists of numbers
-Applied prime-check logic to each element
-Focused on algorithmic thinking over syntax
