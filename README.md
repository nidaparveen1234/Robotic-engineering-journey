# Python Foundations

## Day 1
Programs:
-Prime number check
-Reverse number
Notes:
-Converted logic from C to Python
-Corrected mistake between odd numbers and prime numbers.

## Day 2 – Prime & Palindrome Logic
-Implemented prime number check in Python
-Implemented palindrome check using reverse logic
-Debugged logical errors related to loops and return statements
-Focused on understanding logic rather than speed

## Day 3 – Local Development Setup

-Installed Python on Windows
-Set up VS Code for Python development
-Verified Python execution using terminal
-Implemented and tested prime list and prime check programs locally

## Day 4
-Implemented sum of digits logic
-Used loop-based digit extraction

## Day 5
-Practiced algorithm-to-code conversion
-Strengthened loop and condition thinking

## Day 6
-Worked with lists of numbers
-Applied prime-check logic to each element
-Focused on algorithmic thinking over syntax

## Day 7
-Applied counting pattern on lists
-Counted palindromic numbers using condition checks

## Day 8
-Learned list indexing and traversal
-Practiced creating new lists from existing data
-Strengthened array-like thinking in Python

## Day 9
-Learned to apply conditions over lists
-Practiced counting and filtering patterns
-Focused on single-pass algorithm thinking

## Day 10
-Practiced accumulator and tracker patterns
-Implemented sum, minimum, and maximum logic using single-pass traversal
-Strengthened loop-based decision making

## Day 11
-Learned frequency counting using key–value logic
-Built occurrence maps from lists
-Applied comparison logic to analyze frequency data(working on them)

## Day 12:
-Identified maximum frequency element using dictionary
-Practiced key vs value comparison logic

## Day 13
-Found the minimum and second minimum elements in a list
-Practiced safe initialization and edge case handling

## Day 14
-Reversed an entire list without using built-in functions
-Used two-pointer technique to swap elements

## Day 15
-Reversed a list between specific start and end indices
-Learned how partial reversal works using index boundaries

## Day 16
-Checked whether a list is a palindrome
-Used start and end pointers to compare elements

## Day 17
-Rotated a list up to K times
-Understood how repeated rotations affect element positions

## Day 18
-Implemented left rotation of a list
-Practiced shifting elements using loops and temporary storage

## Day 19
-Implemented right rotation of a list
-Fixed pointer direction issues and inner loop logic

## Day 20:
-Refined list rotation algorithm using k % n to avoid redundant rotations
-Focused on algorithm design and edge cases before final implementation

## Day 21:
-Implemented left and right rotation using separate functions
-Practiced passing lists and variables into functions and improving structure

## Day 22:
-Implemented logic to check whether a list is sorted without sorting it
-Practiced comparing adjacent elements using a while loop and control flow
